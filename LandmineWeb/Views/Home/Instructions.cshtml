        <h3>Back Story <small>(There's always a back story)</small></h3>
        <p>
            A long time ago there was an evil warlord. He was really mean and nasty, and he hated the towns-people of
            Clichédia. He was at war with their chief, and desired to kill the chief's daughter, the beautiful princess
            Predictable. So he set out to plant mines all over her favorite playing fields...
        </p>

        <p>Oh, nevermind. This is a simple, stupid, and frankly, <i>derivative</i>, game. You don't need a backstory.</p>

        <h3>Goal <small>(What's the point???)</small></h3>
        <p>
            Your goal is to clear the field of mines. You are armed only with a pocket full of flags and your trusty
            mine detector. Your mine detector tells you how many mines are in immediately adjacent space.
        </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, it only works when its placed below ground.</p>

        <p>You'll have to dig a hole first!</p>
